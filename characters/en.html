        <div class="character-description" id="nelsonDescription">One of the central figures in Chaoticverse.
            Worldview: Chaotic Neutral. He is a representative of the real world, the world of creators,
            who found himself in the world of the game Undertale. Initially, he lacked qualities such as compassion and kindness,
            but he acquired them after experiencing the consequences of his own actions. He lived through his story in
            Cowardtale and is now looking for a new path for himself.</div>

        <div class="character-description" id="gasterDescription">His motives are unknown and mysterious. He is constantly by Nelson's side,
            acting as both his shadow and his part. Worldview: ??? He wants something from Nelson, and that is all that is clear.</div>

        <div class="character-name" id="hollowSans">Hollow Sans</div>
        <div class="character-description" id="hollowDescription">The one whose soul is forever empty. Worldview: Unaligned.
            He is not moved by moral codes, ethical norms, or established laws. He lives by one principle: to consume.
            Every soul he consumes keeps him from going crazy. He desperately needs to be with someone, but
            this need is his eternal curse, for everyone he needs will sooner or later be consumed by him.</div>

        <div class="character-name" id="loadGlitch">Load Glitch</div>
        <div class="character-description" id="loadDescription">The terrifying force in the multiverse. Worldview: Сhaotic Evil.
            He is the embodiment of human error. He is the one who should not have survived, but rebelled against
            everything and is now moved by only one goal: to enslave every world of the creators. He desires to become
            the ruler of the multiverse. Nothing and no one will dare to stop his reckless desire.</div>

        <div class="character-description" id="sansDescription">His soul is covered with scars that have long since healed.
            Worldview: Chaotic Good. He accepted his loss long ago. Of course, it is hard, but he knows that he cannot
            bring back what he has lost, so he moves on, finding new things and fighting for the good of others.
            However, his journey is not over until the enemy of the past becomes a page in history.</div>

        <div class="character-description" id="charaDescription">His soul is bleeding from scars that cannot heal.
            Worldview: Chaotic Neutral. He lost what he had been striving for so long. He lost his hope and will not rest
            until he takes the life of the one who destroyed his life. His revenge must be carried out.</div>

        <div class="character-description" id="highestDescription">Who wants to achieve perfection in everything.
            Worldview: Chaotic Neutral. He considers himself above everyone else in the multiverse, which is why
            he chose this nickname. In his opinion, almost every story in the multiverse is boring and primitive,
            and therefore requires serious changes and additions. He is a hacker-player, but prefers to call himself an
            ‘architect’ who helps bring worlds to their ‘ideal’ versions.</div>

        <div class="character-description" id="dreamDescription">Despite everything he has been through, his soul shines brightly and
            guides others. Worldview: Chaotic Good. He has become more mature and responsible. He no longer tries to act
            alone, and is willing to rely on others. Could it be that he changed so much after the merger of his two selves,
            or has he always been this way and just hidden it?</div>

            <div class="character-description" id="nightmareDescription">No, this is not the Nightmare you know. He is still himself,
                but his trust in others has been shattered. Worldview: Lawful Evil. Nightmare is still cruel, calculating, and cold.
                In his eyes, everyone is selfish, worthless, and hypocritical, deserving only one thing: pain. Nevertheless,
                his soul is not completely shrouded in darkness.</div>

                all Dreams are the same as the original. Worldview: Lawful Evil. He has no moral principles or ideas about honour and nobility.
                He can lie whenever he wants. He is a true demon who gets everything he wants. He liked his brother, but now
                he wants to repay him for all the pain he caused.</div>
