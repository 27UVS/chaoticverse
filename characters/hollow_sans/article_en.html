Hollow is a monster with an empty soul who has been traveling across the multiverse for a very long time.
He is neither a friend nor an enemy — just a lonely monster. Without feelings, without emotions, without worries,
without a clear sense of self-awareness. The only thing that drives him is hunger, both magical and psychological.
<h2>Backstory</h2>
He used to be Sans — a royal guard who was always by Princess Chara’s side, protecting her from dangers and misfortune.
The work of a guard always seemed dull and exhausting to him, and only Chara’s jokes and teasing ever lifted his spirits.
Yet even so, while the Dreemurr family lived in harmony, his own family was fractured; his relationship with his father
had always been strained and often ended in arguments.
And so it would have continued, until his father appeared right in the middle of his shift, calling everyone
together and announcing the creation of a weapon — a living weapon. And Sans was meant to become it, as the
best candidate of them all. Sans was initially against it, but feeling resentment toward his father and a sense
of duty to Chara, he agreed.
At first, everything went well, but soon it all turned into a catastrophe. The creation of the weapon was corrupted,
and before long the entire universe self-destructed, leaving only a single being alive. That being was completely pure,
a blank canvas. Without magic, without memories, without feelings. It was Hollow.
<h2>Soul</h2>
Soul Hollow is quite unique among the many monsters of the multiverse,
as he stands out with a soul that is empty in every sense — the very reason he received his name.

Hollow’s empty soul is both his blessing and his curse.<br>
On one hand, because his soul is infused with the Core’s energy, he is incapable of dying from old age or in ordinary ways.
On the other hand, that same energy deprives him of emotions, making Hollow similar to Ink in this regard.
He has no aspirations, dreams, or feelings.

     class="text-image medium right"
     alt="HollowVoices">
But while Ink endures emptiness without serious consequences, for Hollow this hollow state leads to voices in his head,
tangled thoughts, and doubts about his own identity — dissociative identity disorder. Therefore, Hollow strives to
keep his soul filled at all times so as not to lose himself.<br>
And unlike Ink, who only needs to drink paint to experience emotions, Hollow must consume souls in order to feel anything.
Any soul contains the owner’s emotions and feelings along with their memories, and that is exactly what Hollow needs.
He absorbs others’ emotions and personalities, trying to fill himself with them. Yet even so, he cannot genuinely
experience these feelings — only skillfully imitate them, pretending.
Unable to feel happiness, bitterness, grief, fear, anger, or love.

<h2>Personality</h2>
Hollow does not truly have a personality.
In his existence, he is closer to an unfeeling machine than to a person. Hollow always prioritizes his own well-being,
taking no interest in anything else. When speaking with Hollow, it may seem that he is an ordinary monster ready to
help or betray, but all of it is merely a set of masks concealing his empty soul.
Hollow thinks of himself first and foremost, and this is not egoism or vanity — it is simply the foundation of
his survival. And even if it seems that he trusts you or even shows you love, know that he has simply
put yet another mask over his emotionless face.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowStaff.webp"
     class="text-image small right"
     alt="HollowStaff">
A distinctive feature of his appearance is the lines on his face that extend from the corners of his mouth.
He hides these lines with dirt of some kind to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to them. These
lines are extensions of his mouth, dividing the lower and upper jaw much like those of a real skeleton.<br>
The clothes he wears are stolen from a wide variety of AUs. Fresh even nicknamed him the multiverse’s bum because of it.
Among his outfit, one can recognize Papyrus’s glove, Blue’s scarf, and boots from XTale. The rest of his clothing raises
questions about its origin.<br>
In his bag, he keeps bandages and vials filled with souls that he “kindly” borrowed from Science!Sans, as well as markers.

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Soul Perception and Containment</h3>
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowSouls.webp"
     class="text-image medium-small left"
     alt="HollowSouls">
Having extensive experience in dealing with souls, Hollow’s vision allows him to see not only what we normally perceive,
but also the soul of every being that possesses one. In addition, if the soul of a monster or a human ends
up in his hands, it will not decay even without a container and will remain stably preserved as long as it stays
within the area of his hand.
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3>Soul Consumption</h3>
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowShape.webp"
     class="text-image medium right"
     alt="HollowShape">
The core process of Hollow’s existence. During it, Hollow’s face changes. When Hollow is about to consume a soul,
he opens his mouth to its full extent, and his eye sockets become empty.
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowEyesSoul.webp"
     class="text-image medium left"
     alt="HollowEyesSoul">
Only when the soul (or several souls) is already inside his mouth do the jaws literally snap shut, and the soul shatters
into fragments with the sound of cracking glass. After this action, Hollow’s eyes return and, for a few seconds,
take on a color corresponding to the magic of the consumed soul.
However, it is worth considering that different souls nourish Hollow differently, just as different human
foods have different calorie values. Human souls, such as Kindness, Patience, and Justice, provide on average 2–3%
saturation. The red soul is most often the most nutritious and saturating — 5–8%. Monster souls have a medium
level of saturation and often vary, since in different universes monster souls can be stronger or weaker, but
on average the percentage ranges from 4–5%. Glitched souls, such as those belonging to Error, Anti-Error, or
Load Glitch, have varying levels of saturation, ranging from 2% to 10%.

<h3>Assimilation</h3>
After consuming a soul, during the process of its “digestion”, Hollow not only reads its emotions and memories,
but also its abilities, granting himself the opportunity to use them temporarily.<br>
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowAbilities.webp"
     class="text-image medium-large left"
     alt="HollowAbilities">
Possessing immense experience, Hollow adapts perfectly to almost any ability, as if he had always possessed it.
If he acquires an ability whose principle is little known or unknown to him, Hollow must conduct an internal
analysis of the soul’s available memories in order to learn this power through another’s experience. Even after
such a process, however, his mastery of an unfamiliar power may not be perfect.<br>
It is not exactly known how long Hollow can use an assimilated power, but it is known that the more often he uses it,
the faster it begins to weaken and fade from Hollow’s body until it disappears completely.<br>
Abilities cannot be mixed, only used in combination.

<h3>Blood Portals</h3>
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowBlood.webp"
     class="text-image medium right"
     alt="HollowBlood">
Despite the name, Hollow has no blood, as he is obviously a skeleton.
However, inside his bones there is indeed a dark-scarlet liquid which, in terms of its function, truly serves as
blood for Hollow, though in composition it is not blood. This is what the souls Hollow has consumed look like
while being digested. The more souls Hollow has eaten, the more of this “blood” he has; the fewer he has eaten,
the less of it remains.<br>
When such “blood” is spilled, it can rise into the air and form an oval outline in which a white portal with
red hues appears. Such portals can transport Hollow to any point in the multiverse he can think of. If no
destination is chosen, the portal will send him to a random location. The more blood is spilled, the longer the
portal will last, since it cannot remain stable indefinitely and continuously consumes the spilled blood.<br>
Hollow himself does not know the reason for possessing such a power, but he uses it often due to its effectiveness.
However, it also causes inconvenience, as losing blood causes Hollow to become exhausted more quickly — something
Hollow almost never allows to happen.<br>

<h3>Dreams</h3>
<img src="../../images/characters/hollow_sans/HollowMVs.webp"
     class="text-image medium left"
     alt="HollowMVs">
It may seem that Hollow does not dream, or that his dreams consist of fragmented memories of the victims he
has consumed, which is partly true. However, his dreams also allow him to see what is simply inaccessible to others.<br>
As a being that is empty within, Hollow exists on a thin thread between life and death. This thread is so thin that no
distances between dimensions and spaces can limit Hollow’s consciousness, allowing him to witness the lives of other
versions of himself from other multiverses. He sees from a first-person perspective other versions of his path, whose
circumstances and events may differ only slightly or diverge drastically from the version familiar to him.<br>
This power is not a means of communication or a collective consciousness among Hollows from different multiverses;
it merely grants the ability to observe events through other eyes, without influencing the surroundings in any way,
while the main body sleeps. Thanks to these dreams, almost all Hollows possess an immense reservoir of knowledge that
can surpass even the omniscience of Core!Frisk.<br>
