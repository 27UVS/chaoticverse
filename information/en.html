<p id="whatIsChaoticverse">
  The Chaoticverse is a massive crossover project involving multiple Undertale and Deltarune fandom projects,
  united within the context of interconnected stories. Chaoticverse has key protagonist and antagonist,
  who are the catalysts for most of the events. However, the project is dedicated to the stories of other, equally significant
  characters who directly influence the key events. As long as the fandom lives on, chaos continues to grow in
  Chaoticverse. The only question is where this chaos will lead. To destruction or a new future?

  Resistance was a story about the sons of Mei, the guardian of the Tree of Magic:
  Create and Chaos. It was about how their story began in Poisetale, how it was destroyed by one scientist,
  and then turned into a large-scale struggle for the life of the multiverse. The protagonist of the story was Geno.
  However, this project fell apart due to insufficient development and too much similarity to another project.
  Therefore, work was done to correct the mistakes, form a new view of the fandom, study many other works,
  and create new characters. Thus, Chaoticverse became a reboot of Resistance with new perspectives and ideas.

  The principle of existence of Chaoticverse lies in its arrangement
  of timelines and distortions. The Chaoticverse is a huge time tree, where each turn is a deviation from another story.
  In other words, if Undertale has branches as
  <a href="https://loverofpiggies.tumblr.com/ATfancomic">Aftertale</a>,
  <a href="https://rahafwabas.tumblr.com">Something New</a>,
  <a href="https://horrortalecomic.tumblr.com">Horrortale</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/thezombiedogz">Disbelief</a>
  and others, then the Chaoticverse branches can serve as
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/xtaleunderverse">Underverse</a>,
  <a href="https://tatatale.tumblr.com">ALIVE</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/galacii-gallery">Shattered Fates</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/admixverse-official">Admixverse</a>, etc.

<p id="howChaoticverseIsWorking2">
  The reason for this phenomenon was the actions of Error in
  <a href="https://ut-storyshift.tumblr.com">Storyshift</a>. After he used his special attack once, the
  entire Storyshift with its branches Storyfell, Storyswap, etc. were destroyed almost instantly.
  This corrupted the time stream of the multiverse and created the first time distortion,
  dividing the multiverse into two time streams for the first time: where Storyshift and its alternate versions no longer exist,
  and where Storyshift and its alternatives survived but were restarted.
  Following this event, new time distortions began to emerge. Such changes led to the fact that
  characters whose alternative versions should not exist gradually began to appear, and characters
  with powers of foresight or knowledge of the future stopped seeing it clearly. Moreover, the
  further spread of the “players” beyond their timelines and AU also contributed to this.
  So the multiverse began to descend into chaos and some had to adapt to the new conditions,
  while others remained unaware or did not notice the problem.<br>
  Since then, in the Chaoticverse, the probability of any unexpected collisions has increased exponentially,
  and encounters between two identical outcodes have become usual. But some timelines definitely cannot
  exist within the structure of the Chaoticverse, such as
  <a href="https://alphatale.fandom.com/wiki/Alphaverse">Alphaverse</a>,
  <a href="https://truegodverse.fandom.com/wiki/Godverse_Wiki">GODVERSE</a> and similar ones. The principle
  of the emergence and existence of these stories differs significantly from others, and therefore they are exceptions in this project.

  At the moment, the project practically does not accept applications for
  adding new characters, but in the future it is planned to organize an application form.
